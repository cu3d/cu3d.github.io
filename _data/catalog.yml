  textloc: "Stewart 11.7 Maximum and Minimum values"
  description: "A surface which a monkey can straddle with both legs and his tail. It is given by the equation $z=x^3-3xy^2$. The monkey saddle has a single critical point. The second derivative test is not sufficient to classify this critical point; it turns out to be a saddle point."
- name: Cross sections

  textloc: "Stewart 6.2 Volumes of Solids by Cross Sections"
  description: "These volumes all have a fixed bases given by circles, squares, or parabolas and have cross-sections given by rectangles or triangles. These cross-sections can be more easily seen by the discrete approximations to the volumes."
- name: Paraboloids

  description: "These models show the volume of a solid paraboloid being approximated using the disk and shell methods of integration."

  textloc: "Stewart 11.7 Maximum and Minimum values"
  description: "The surface given by the equation $z=x^2-y^2$ has a critical point at the origin that is neither a relative maximum nor a relative minimum."
- name: Triangle parabola

  textloc: "Stewart 6.2 Exercise 43"
  description: "The base of the solid is the region enclosed by the parabola $y=1-x^2$ and the $x$-axis. The cross-sections perpendicular to the $x$-axis are isosceles triangles with height equal to the base."
- name: Wedge

  textloc: "Stewart 6.2 Exercise 46" 
  description: "A wedge cut out of a circular cylinder of radius 4 by two planes. One plane is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder. The other intersects the first at an angle of 30$^circ$ along a diameter of the cylinder."
