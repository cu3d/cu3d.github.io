The website for 3D models used for lower-division MATH curriculum at CU Boulder.

Thanks to Athena Sparks, Cherry Ng, Faan Tone Liu, and Carly Matson for setting up the program.

> The department's 3D printer program was funded by the math department and by ASSETT, which backs projects to improve undergraduate education at CU Boulder. The main purpose of this printer is to give instructors the opportunity to supplement their teaching with 3D models.
